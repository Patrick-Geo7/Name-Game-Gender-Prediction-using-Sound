# Name-Game-Gender-Prediction-using-Sound
A Datacamp Guided Project
gender prediction based on name phonetics using the NYSIIS algorithm
Used the python's fuzzy package to apply the [NYSIIS]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Identification_and_Intelligence_System algorithm on Children's Picture Books authors'names to predict their gender
With the help of the babynames_nysiis.csv file provided from [the Social Security Administration's baby name data]https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html, a file containting the nysiis encoding of baby names with the percentages of being male or female.
The project focused mainly on the python matplotlib and pandas libraries.
I enjoyed it a lot!
